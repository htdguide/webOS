## **What's Inside**

### **React Frontend**
The UI is built with React and Vite, offering:
- A **desktop-inspired design** with draggable, resizable app windows.
- Interactive elements like desktop icons and background video wallpapers.
- Smooth performance with optimized build times.

### **WebAssembly Integration**
- **C++ and Raylib**:  
  WebAssembly enables running C++ code in the browser, supporting features like:
  - A **Sorting Algorithms Visualizer**.
  - Experiments with game-like functionality.
- **Performance Benefits**:  
  Near-native performance for compute-heavy operations.

### **Dockerized Setup**
- **Consistent Environments**:  
  Docker ensures compatibility across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Automated Deployment**:  
  Images are built, pushed to Docker Hub, and pulled by the server automatically.

### **Automated CI/CD**
- **Continuous Deployment** via **GitHub Actions**:
  - Docker builds and pushes images.
  - Updates the live server seamlessly.

### **Makefile Automation**
Simplifies WebAssembly builds:
- Automates compilation with Emscripten.
- Optimizes binaries for better performance.

### **Vite Integration**
- Faster builds and hot module replacement (HMR) for improved development experience.
